Implementation of Structured light 3D scanner based on Gray-code - Phase-shift technique. The code was developed using the [Codeblocks IDE](http://www.codeblocks.org/), and it is not cleaned yet, therefore, still contains the CodeBlocks auto-generated project files.  
This project was part of my Masters. Thesis detailing the approach implemented in this project is available (here)[https://github.com/pranavkantgaur/MyDocs/blob/master/H.B.N.I.%20Mtech%20thesis/Thesis_work/Latex_thesis_work/my_thesis_template/main.pdf].
