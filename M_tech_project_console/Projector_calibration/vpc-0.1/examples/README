This directory includes 3 examples of how to use the 
main calibration routines. These examples all take in input
YAML files that contains matching points camera <--> projectors
and extra info (depending on the method). After reading the arguments, 
the demo programs perform the calibration and applied a bundle adjustment
optimization. Results are printed to stdout.

For exact usage, run each demo with no parameters.

**main_direct: This is the direct calibration demo. It requires
			   a matching point wall<-->camera, these matches are
			   obtained using a physical chessboard on the wall.
**main_sampling: This is the sampling method. It needs the camera parameters
				 (at least principal point).
**main_autocalib: This is the autocalbration method. It requires matches of
				  camera<-->projector in fronto-// configuration and of course
				  matches in general positions.
